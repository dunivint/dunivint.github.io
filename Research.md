__Centralia, PA__: Centralia, Pennsylvania is the site of an underground coal seam fire that ignighted in 1962. The fire burns along coal seam deep underground, heating overlying surface soils and, in some locations, exposing them to coal combustion pollutants. As the fire progresses, areas once affected are allowed to cool and potentially recover from the disturbance. I am interested in how microbial communities (or the microbiome) of these soils changes during and after this disturbance. Specifically, I am interested in wether it impacts resistance genes such as _antibiotic_ and _arsenic_ resistance genes.
