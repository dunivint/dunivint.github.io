 __Centralia, PA__: Centralia, Pennsylvania is the site of an underground coal seam fire that ignighted in 1962. The fire burns along coal seam deep underground, heating overlying surface soils and, in some locations, exposing them to coal combustion pollutants. As the fire progresses, areas once affected are allowed to cool and potentially recover from the disturbance. I am interested in how microbial communities (or the microbiome) of these soils changes during and after this disturbance. Specifically, I am interested in wether it impacts resistance genes such as _antibiotic_ and _arsenic_ resistance genes.

 __Arsenic resistance genes__: Microbial arsenic resistance mechanisms have important implications for public health since they can impact the fate of arsenic, a known poison and carcinogen, in the environment. I am developing methods to improve and streamline annotation of arsenic resistance genes from sequencing data so that we can get a better understanding of the distribution and abundance of these genes in the environment and potentially improve bioremediation and risk assessment. I am applying these methods to several soil metagenomes to test the abundance of different arsenic resistance genes in non-contaminated environemnts throughout the world.

 __Arsenic resistance and evolution__: While arsenic resistance genes have been studied for many years, researchers are only recently beginning to uncover the array of non-specific cellular responses to arsenic. An arsenic resistant isolate collection from Centralia, PA showed lineage-specific growth phenotypes in arsenic, suggesting a role for non-specific responses to arsenic in addition to classical resistance. I am further probing this observation in a collaboration with the Lenski Lab at Michigan State University. Kyle Card and I are testing changes in arsenic growth phenotypes in evolved and ancestor strains from the long term evolution experiment (LTEE). Knowledge of cellular responses to arsenic that increase or decrease an organisms success has important implications for health (cellular survival in the face of arsenic) and ecology (how microbial communities might shift with arsenic exposure).
