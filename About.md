I am currently PhD candidate in the departments of Microbiology & Molecular Genetics and Environmental Toxicology in [Ashley Shade's lab](http://ashley17061.wixsite.com/shadelab) at Michigan State University. My research focuses on using metagenomic analysis to understand arsenic and antibiotic resistance gene dynamics in soil microbial communities. My work is motivated by an enthusiasm for improving public health through environmental health. I am also the course coordinator for the Explorations in Data Analyses for Metagenomic Advances in Microbial Ecology (EDAMAME) Workshop ([edamamecourse.org](http://www.edamamecourse.org/)) hosted at [Kellogg Biological Station](http://www.kbs.msu.edu/). Ultimately, I want to work in science policy and am currently interning with [ScienceDebate](sciencedebate.org), a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that encourages politicians to share their views on science policy issues.
