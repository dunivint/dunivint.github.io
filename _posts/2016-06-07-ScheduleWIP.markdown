Our [Wiki](https://github.com/edamame-course/2016-tutorials/wiki) and course [schedule](https://github.com/edamame-course/2016-tutorials/wiki/Schedule-EDAMAME-2016) is coming together!  We've got awesome confirmed guest speakers, including National Academy members [Jim Tiedje](https://mmg.natsci.msu.edu/people/faculty/tiedje-james/) and [Rich Lenski](https://telliamedrevisited.wordpress.com/) (tweet! @RELenski) from Michigan State.  Check back often for updates and sneak previews of our tutorials as we roll them out!
