Weâ€™re excited to announce that we are accepting applications for the Explorations in Data Analyses for Metagenomic Advances in Microbial Ecology (EDAMAME) workshop at Kellogg Biological Station 6-12 August 2017.  EDAMAME is an intensive, hands-on course in microbial metagenome analyses, covering workflows from raw sequence analysis through to multivariate statistics and ecological interpretation.
