I support the course through applicant review, logistics organization, website upkeep, and instructing. EDAMAME is dedicated to open source science, so we provide all of  our tutorials for free [GitHub](https://github.com/edamame-course).EDAMAME is supported by the National Institutes of Health (1R25GM115335-01), the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Award 2016-68003-24604), and by the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action. Students, faculty, or industry workers interested in the course can visit [edamamecourse.org](http://www.edamamecourse.org/) for more information.

Together, we worked on automating bioinformatics pipelines to assemble arsenic resistance genes from metagenomic data. Ultimately, we hope these data will lead to insights into the ecology and evolution of arsenic resistance genes. Students interested in the iCER ACRES program should visit [icer-acres.msu.edu](https://icer-acres.msu.edu/) for more information.

__Introductory Laboratory for Microbiology – Spring 2017__: I instructed 60 students, teaching microbiology techniques such as streak plating, microscopy, and several medical microbiology protocols. 

<br>

 __Laboratory in Genomics and Molecular Genetics – Spring 2016__: In this course, I taught 20 advanced undergraduate students molecular techniqes including RNA extraction and RT-qPCR as well as bioinformatics such as RNA-seq data analysis.

 __Undergraduate student mentor – 2015-2016__: Mentored a senior undergraduate at Michigan State University, Justine Miller. We worked on characterizing arsenic resistant bacteria cultured from Centralia, PA soils, the site of an underground coal mine fire. Justine is now interested in applying her microbiology skills at veternary school.
